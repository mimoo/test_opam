## Pre-requesites

Some of the dependencies here are not published on the opam repository, so you'll have to add the [O(1) labs opam repository](https://github.com/o1-labs/opam-repository) first.

```
opam repository add --yes --all --set-default o1-labs https://github.com/o1-labs/opam-repository.git
opam install snarky
```
